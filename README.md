# LGMonitorControl
Replacement App for "LG OnScreen Control" to automatically change LG Monitor GameMode profiles depending on running foreground app since OEM software is trash.

- Super fast
- Super lightweight
- Tested on my LG 34" ultrawide gaming monitor (should work for all LG with same modes)

If you would like to buy me a coffee for my work: It is greatly appreciated.
