# LGMonitorControl
## Replacement App for "LG OnScreen Control"


- automatically change LG Monitor GameMode profiles depending on running app 
- super fast
- super lightweight
- tested on my LG 34" ultrawide gaming monitor (should work for all LG with same modes)
- put a shortcut in your autostart folder to make it start on boot (registry option triggers a false threat)

If you would like to buy me a coffee for my work: It is greatly appreciated.
